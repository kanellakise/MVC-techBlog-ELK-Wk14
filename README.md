## Features

This project is primarily coded in JavaScript, with dashes of HTML here and there. Npm packages used consist of Express.js (for server operation and session creation), Handlebars.js (for contextual HTML generation), bcrypt (for password encryption), dotenv (to hide that spicy classified information), and a MySQL database (for storage of data).
